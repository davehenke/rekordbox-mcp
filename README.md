## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Export Your Rekordbox Library

**Required Step**: You must export your rekordbox library as XML first.

1. Open **rekordbox**
2. Go to **File** ‚Üí **Export Collection in XML format**
3. Save the XML file (e.g., `rekordbox.xml`)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This server works with XML exports only.

### 2. Install the Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rekordbox-mcp
cd rekordbox-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

### 3. Configure Your MCP Client

The server requires the path to your XML file as a startup argument:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rekordbox": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/rekordbox-mcp/dist/index.js",
        "/path/to/your/rekordbox.xml"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

        "/path/to/rekordbox.xml"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor IDE

          "/path/to/rekordbox.xml"  
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üìä What Data is Available?

The server parses your rekordbox XML export and provides access to:

### Track Metadata
- **Basic Info**: Title, Artist, Album, Genre, Year, Label
- **Technical**: BPM, Key (Camelot notation), Duration, File format
- **DJ Data**: Play count, Rating (0-5), Comments/Energy levels
- **File System**: Complete file paths and filenames

### Performance Data

- **Beat Grids**: Tempo changes and beat markers
- **Analysis**: Key detection and BPM analysis results

### Playlist Structure  
- **Hierarchical**: Nested playlist folders and organization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

### XML-Based Approach
- **Manual Export Required**: Must export XML from rekordbox manually
- **No Real-time Sync**: Changes don't automatically reflect in rekordbox
- **Update Workflow**: Re-export XML when library changes significantly

### Data Scope
- **No Artwork**: Album covers not included in XML exports
- **No Waveforms**: Audio analysis data not available
- **Limited Metadata**: Some rekordbox-specific data may be missing

### File System Dependencies
- **Absolute Paths**: XML contains full file paths that may change
- **Missing Files**: Broken if tracks moved/deleted after export

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

We're continuously working to improve the rekordbox MCP server. Potential future features include:

- **Enhanced Analytics**: Advanced library insights and recommendations
- **Multiple Format Support**: Additional playlist and export formats
- **Performance Optimizations**: Faster processing of large libraries
- **Extended Metadata**: Support for additional rekordbox data fields
