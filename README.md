# Rekordbox MCP Server

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for rekordbox database management with real-time database access.

**Built using [pyrekordbox](https://github.com/dylanljones/pyrekordbox)** - This project is not affiliated with the pyrekordbox project or its maintainers.

## Features

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Access
- **Direct SQLite Database Connection**: Access the encrypted rekordbox database directly using pyrekordbox
- **Real-time Queries**: Search and filter tracks with comprehensive criteria
- **Read-Only Operations**: Safe database access without modification risks

### üîç Search & Discovery
- **Advanced Search**: Multi-field search across artist, title, genre, key, BPM, and more
- **Musical Key Filtering**: Find tracks in compatible keys for harmonic mixing
- **BPM Range Queries**: Search by tempo ranges for beatmatching
- **Rating and Play Count Filters**: Discover your most loved and most played tracks

### üìä Analytics & Insights
- **Library Statistics**: Comprehensive stats including genre distribution, average BPM, total playtime
- **Play Count Analytics**: Track listening patterns and habits
- **Collection Insights**: Understand your music library composition
- **DJ History Access**: Full access to your DJ session history and performance data

### ‚öôÔ∏è Database Operations
- **Playlist Access**: View and analyze playlist content including smart playlists
- **History Analysis**: Access complete DJ session history and performance data
- **Library Statistics**: Comprehensive analytics and insights

## Architecture

This project consists of two complementary approaches:

### Python Server (Current)
- **FastMCP Framework**: Modern Python MCP server using FastMCP 2.0
- **pyrekordbox Integration**: Mature library for encrypted database access
- **Real-time Database Queries**: Direct SQLite operations with SQLCipher support
- **Production Ready**: Built-in logging, error handling, and safety features

### TypeScript Server (Legacy)
- **XML-based Access**: Uses rekordbox XML exports for read-only operations
- **MCP SDK**: Built with the official TypeScript MCP SDK
- **Static Analysis**: Perfect for analysis without database modification risk

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Notice

**BACKUP YOUR REKORDBOX LIBRARY BEFORE USE**

This software directly accesses your rekordbox database for analysis and querying. While currently read-only, **always create a backup** of your entire rekordbox library before using this tool as a precautionary measure.

### Backup Requirements

**You should create a complete backup of your rekordbox library before using this software.** Consult rekordbox documentation or support resources for proper backup procedures for your specific setup and rekordbox version.

### Risk Acknowledgment

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **This project accesses your rekordbox database directly**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use at your own risk - no warranty provided**  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test thoroughly with backups before using on your main library**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **The developers are not responsible for any data loss or damage**

**If you are not comfortable with these risks, use the read-only XML export functionality instead.**

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- rekordbox 6 or 7 installed with an existing library
- **COMPLETE BACKUP** of your rekordbox library (see safety notice above)
- Access to your rekordbox database (automatic detection supported)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# Run the server
uv run rekordbox-mcp
```

### Configuration

The server supports both automatic database detection and manual configuration:

```bash
# Auto-detect rekordbox database (recommended)
uv run rekordbox-mcp

# Specify custom database path
uv run rekordbox-mcp --database-path /path/to/rekordbox/Pioneer
```

### MCP Client Setup

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rekordbox-database": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "rekordbox-mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/rekordbox-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

### Search & Query
- `search_tracks` - Advanced track search with multiple filters
- `get_track_details` - Detailed track information including metadata
- `get_library_stats` - Comprehensive library statistics
- `get_playlists` - List all playlists (including smart playlists)
- `get_playlist_tracks` - Get tracks in a specific playlist

### DJ History
- `get_history_sessions` - Browse all DJ session history
- `get_session_tracks` - Get full tracklist for any DJ session
- `get_recent_sessions` - Filter recent DJ sessions
- `get_history_stats` - Comprehensive DJ performance statistics
- `search_history_sessions` - Search sessions by date, tracks, etc.

### Database Operations
- `connect_database` - Establish database connection

### Resources
- `database-status` - Current connection status and basic stats

## Examples

### Search for tracks by key and BPM
```python
# Find tracks in 5A key with BPM between 120-130
search_tracks(key="5A", bpm_min=120, bpm_max=130, limit=20)
```

### Access DJ History
```python
# Get recent DJ sessions
get_recent_sessions(days=30)

# Get tracks from a specific session
get_session_tracks(session_id="12345")
```


### Get library insights
```python
# Comprehensive library statistics
get_library_stats()

# DJ performance statistics
get_history_stats()
```

## Safety Features

- **Read-Only Operations**: Currently operates in read-only mode for safe database access
- **Connection Validation**: Validates database connections and access
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- **Input Validation**: Input validation for all database operations

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: These safety features are supplementary protections. Always maintain your own backups and use this software at your own risk.
